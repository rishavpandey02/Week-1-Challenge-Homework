# Week-1-Homework-Challenge
Week 1 homework challenge is done using HTML and CSS code. 

## Description
The main object of the assessment was to simplify, shorten and make the code look cleaner.

This was done by removing any unnecessary code.

Or by grouping certain class/ ID codes together on the CSS file.

## Features
The features of my code for the webpage compared to the orginal code are that:
- I removed unnecessary divs (even replaced one with nav ,the header one,), simplified class names, and applied consistent formatting to make the code cleaner, making it easier to read and understand.
- In the start of the HTML code that is for the text on the right side of the header, i have put one li for all 3 of the <a, instead of 1 li for each <a.
- I put the paragraph codes on the same command line (done to make the code look cleaner)
- I put merged the class and Id's that had the same information in them

## File Structure
When you open the repo
  
There will be a Assets folder and a develop folder.
  
In the "Assets" folder will be a photo of what the webpage looks like. (This is in the folder that was given to us by the TA).
  
Inside the "develop" folder will be another Assets folder and a "HTML" file (index.html).
  
The "HTML" files has all the html work.
  
The "Assets" folder has another folder called "images" and a "CSS" folder.
  
The "images" folder contains all the images that are used for the prject.
  
The "CSS" folder contains CSS file (style.css).
